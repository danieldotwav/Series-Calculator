# Series Calculator

A C++ program that calculates two different series: Series 1 and Series 2. 

## Description

This C++ program allows you to calculate two distinct mathematical series:
1. **Series 1:** 1/(0+1) + 1/(1+2) + ... + 1/((n-1)+n)
2. **Series 2:** (n*n) + ((n-1)*(n-1)) + ... + (2*2) + (1*1)

The program provides a user-friendly menu to select which series to calculate, input the value of 'n', and displays the result. Additionally, it offers the option to exit the program gracefully.

## Features

- User-friendly menu for selecting series and inputting values.
- Recursive functions for calculating both Series 1 and Series 2.
- Optional display of intermediate steps in the calculation.
- Graceful exit option.

## Usage

1. Choose the series you want to calculate from the menu.
2. Input the value of 'n' for the series.
3. Optionally, see the intermediate steps in the calculation.
4. Get the result.
5. Repeat or exit as needed.
